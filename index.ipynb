    "# Extract CV (PDF) To JSON with Mistral\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is designed to extract structured data from a PDF file (in this case, a CV or resume) using a language model. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing Required Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ChatMistralAI from langchain_mistralai.chat_models:  \n",
    "This is the language model used for processing the text.\n",
    "BaseModel and Field from pydantic: These are used to define the structure of the extracted data.\n",
    "2. PyPDFLoader from langchain_community.document_loaders:   \n",
    "This is used to load and split the PDF file into pages. List from typing: This is used to define the type of the skills field in the CVDataExtraction model. The PyPDFLoader is used to load the PDF file named cv.pdf. The load_and_split method splits the PDF into individual pages.\n",
    "3. Typing :   \n",
    "The typing module provides a standard way to define these type hints, which can improve code readability, help with debugging, and enable better support from IDEs and static type checkers.\n",
    "4. SSL :  \n",
    "Standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. In the context of Python programming, the ssl module provides access to Transport Layer Security (previously known as Secure Sockets Layer) encryption and peer authentication facilities for network sockets."

It includes fields for various candidate details like full name, email, job titles, skills, professional experience, education, publications, distinctions, and certifications. The model ensures that the data is organized and validated. After extracting and combining the text from a PDF file, the model is used with a MistralAI model to process the CV and output the data in a structured format, like JSON, for further use."
